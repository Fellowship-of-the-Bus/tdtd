functional market menus
-click button in market, attaches mouse listener that draws an image of the selected tower under the mouse

hotkeys

info view should be able to display enemies

dolphin velocity should reset when it turns

tower that can be put only on one side should only be drawn on that side when being placed

display messages and other UI indicators whenever a user does something that they shouldn't
buttons which are conditionally selectable
-can't click to place a tower in a location that they shouldn't (can we store whether a location is placable in the map after running Djikstra's? Then we can display green/red depending on whether a tile is placeable)

enemies should come on both layers at the same time

wave bar should decrement as enemies spawn or die/escape

move upgrade button so that it does not overlap text on oil drill

send wave should be an arrow icon

lives and money should be more prominent (change color?)

range circle should not cross map border

drag to place towers?

djikstra bugs

disable AI for things that don't shoot (e.g. oil drill)
